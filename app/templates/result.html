  <h3>Hey! prediction complete</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">Now the results of your prediction is below and it is good to Note that the prediction was done using Decision tree algorithm whilst implementing Logistic regression which is one of the common regression techniques used in Machine Learning. This solution can be implemented using SVC RNN and a host of other techniques, provided the technique and algorithm doesnt overfit or underfit during the Data training and consumption, this project is Open source!
