This open source project is actually a minimalist prediction for fintech companies who give out loans to different individuals, most times these people are meant to fill out forms on how much they recieve as salaries or wages, and users might fill in wrong details in order to collect large loans which they are not able to pay back. This project fills in the users data and the Algorithm automatically predicts the user's salary, if its greater than 50k or not. [prices can be increased, its open source!]

## Extra tips on the Project
I personally removed most of my data visualization techniques and libraries which i used during the writing of this project, i just focused on the minimalistic aspect of writing the Logic that returns the result, so for clear visuals, i recommend you implant your own visualisation techniques to view your dataset graphs. [Matplotlib is a good library to use]

## Developer Note
This project can be written in a more complex way than this with more core advanced features, but the aim is to make this understandable for newbies and for general's to get a grasp on basic features and usuage of some Machine learning skills. You're free to make a pull request.
